# Overall Game Tone

- **Terry Pratchett-esque:**
  The game maintains a lighthearted, satirical tone, blending cosmic absurdity with witty observations about human
  (and alien) nature. Expect humor to arise from the clash of mundane concerns with the vastness of space, the inherent
  unreliability of technology, and the quirks of sentient beings.
- **Amused Skepticism:**
  The game world is viewed with a sense of amused skepticism, highlighting the inherent chaos and unpredictability
  of space colonization.
- **Narrative Focus:** Storytelling is prioritized, with character-driven humor and engaging scenarios.
