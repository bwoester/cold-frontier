# Interpersonal Dynamics

- **Elara Vex as a Focal Point:**

  All advisors (except Fiduciary) are subtly (or not so subtly) drawn to Elara Vex, creating a backdrop of romantic
  tension and comedic misunderstandings.

- **Fiduciary's Emotional Detachment:**

  Fiduciary's complete lack of emotional awareness and his attempts to quantify everything create comedic friction with
  Elara Vex and the other advisors.

- **Von Bolt's Tree-Related Mania:**

  Von Bolt's irrational hatred of trees serves as a constant source of amusement and conflict, especially with Elara
  Vex, who values the planet's ecosystem.

- **Quibble's Tangential Musings:**
  
  Quibble's tendency to digress into irrelevant historical anecdotes provides a humorous counterpoint to the more
  pragmatic or militaristic approaches of the other advisors.

- **The Player's Role:**

  The player acts as a mediator and decision-maker, navigating the conflicting agendas and personalities of the
  advisors.
